Automagically convert text to internal links on your website.

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin automagically converts text in the body of your pages whose name corresponds to webpages on your website into links. For example, if you have a webpage entitled "Foo Bar" on your website, when the words "Foo Bar" appear in the text of a page named "Hello World," the words will automatically be linked to the "Foo Bar" webpage.

== Installation ==
Place the plugin's folder into your WordPress plugin folder.
